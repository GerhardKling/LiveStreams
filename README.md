# Live 2: Financial Crime & Cyber Security: The Power of Data
This live stream provides a brief overview of cybercrime in the UK and how young people can be targeted. We will talk about privacy and anonymity online, including VPNs (virtual private networks). Hacking is often wrongly portrayed in the media. I will show you a “real” attack conducted in our safe cybersecurity lab. Depending on your interests, we can also discuss cryptos or related topics. Just use the chat function to ask questions and provide feedback.
